This blog will be used to document my progress in learning reverse engineering. I plan on starting out with completing some basic tutorials then eventually move onto tackling projects on my own once I feel more comfortable. I am planning on documenting any struggles or mistakes that I have made as I complete each project. Hopefully by doing this I will avoid making the same mistakes again, and I can help anybody reading my posts learn from my mistakes as well. 

### More Information

This website is pretty bare. However, I plan on updating everything as I add content.
